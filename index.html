    <h1>“A tour I experienced”</h1>
    <p>

        Man is not satisfied with what he has seen and known. A visit to a place of historical interest is really interesting and attractive. Dhaka is the place of my experienced. During the last summer vacation I, along with some of my friends, decided to go to Savar to see the National Memorial. Before three days of this tour, I started shopping and then packing bags for the tour. I was very excited before the tour. Accordingly, we fixed a date and started our journey from Gabtali to Savar at 10 p.m. by bus. We reached the National Memorial just after 45 minutes. Actually, the National Memorial at Savar is the symbol of the nation’s respect for the martyrs of the war of liberation. It contains the history of our independence. It is built with concrete but made of blood. It stands 150 feet tall, but every martyr it stands for stands so much taller. There is actually a series of 7 towers that rise by stages to a height of 150 feet. Reaching there we felt great respect for the freedom fighters who sacrificed their valuable lives for us. We took some snaps taking the view of the memorial. However, we visited the place and the surrounding area for about an hour. The most moving sight of the complex is the several graves of the martyred freedom fighters just close to the tower. However, we left the place paying our glowing tribute to the freedom fighters. Through this visit, we experienced a lot.</p>
